# OpenCV Computer Vision Projects Using Python

This repository contains a collection of real-time computer vision applications developed using Python and OpenCV. The project focuses on practical implementation of image processing techniques such as color detection, shape recognition, directional analysis, and QR code scanning using live webcam input. It is designed to help students and developers understand core computer vision concepts and apply them in robotics and automation systems.

## Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with OpenCV-based vision processing. By working with these programs, users can learn how digital images are converted into useful information and how objects can be detected and analyzed in real time.

**Objectives include:**

* Understanding real-time video processing
* Implementing HSV color segmentation
* Learning contour detection techniques
* Performing shape classification
* Developing QR scanning applications
* Building foundations for robotics vision

---

## Modules Included

This repository contains multiple independent vision modules, each demonstrating a specific computer vision task.

**Color Detection Modules:**

* Multi-color HSV detection with live percentage display
* RGB object separation using HSV masks
* Bounding box based color labeling
* Blue-only HSV analysis mode

**Vision Analysis Modules:**

* Arrow direction detection system
* Shape detection (Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Circle)

**Scanning Module:**

* Real-time QR code detection and decoding

Each module can be executed individually and works directly with the system webcam.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following tools and libraries:

* Python 3 programming language
* OpenCV library for image processing
* NumPy for matrix and numerical operations
* USB or laptop webcam for video input

---

## Installation Procedure

To run the project, required libraries must be installed on your system.

**Steps:**

* Install Python 3
* Open terminal or command prompt
* Run the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

After installation, connect your webcam and ensure it is properly detected by the system.

## Execution Instructions

Each program can be run separately based on the required functionality.

**Steps to run:**

* Open project folder
* Select the required Python file
* Run using command:

```
python filename.py
```

**Controls:**

* Press **Q** to exit the application
* Some programs support keyboard and mouse interaction
